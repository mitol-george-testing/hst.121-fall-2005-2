description: 'This resource provides information about mucosal barrier function, innate
  humoral factors, TLR ligands and their receptors, commensal bacteria regulate mucosal
  gene expression, innate humoral

  factors: Defensins, luminal factors, enrichment of dimeric (d)IgA in

  mucosal secretions relative to serum

  which contains monomeric IgA, structure of polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), intracellular
  transport of pIgA via pIgR, quantification of IgA production in mucosal secretions,
  intrinsic barrier function of epithelium, pathways for antigen-uptake from the lumen,
  epithelial transport of macromolecules, antigen presentation by absorptive epithelial
  cell, Peyer?s patch development, and concept of the common MALT.'
